CM Punk (born 1978) is an American retired professional wrestler, best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), in which his 434-day reign as WWE Champion stands as the sixth-longest in history.  His professional career on the independent circuit, primarily with Ring of Honor (ROH), began in 1999, and he won the ROH World Championship once. He signed with WWE in 2005, won several championships, and became WWE's 19th Triple Crown Champion in 203 days, the fastest wrestler to achieve this. He is also the only back-to-back Money in the Bank winner, won Superstar of the Year at the 2011 Slammy Awards, and was twice voted Wrestler of the Year. His wrestling character was consistently portrayed as outspoken, confrontational, sharp-tongued, anti-establishment, straight edge, and iconoclastic. He retired from professional wrestling in 2014, and then pursued a short-lived career in mixed martial arts. He later worked as a commentator with Cage Fury Fighting Championships (CFFC), and as an analyst on WWE Backstage.
